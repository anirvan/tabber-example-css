This is a simplified version of the example CSS files packaged with
Tabber 1.9 by Patrick Fitzgerald, and distributed under the MIT
license <http://www.barelyfitz.com/projects/tabber/>.

Read the directions in "tabber.screen.css" to see how to customize the
tab colors. Don't forget to include links to the CSS files in your
HTML, like this (make sure the links point to the right URL):

  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="tabber.screen.css" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="print" href="tabber.print.css" />
